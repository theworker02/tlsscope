## 1. Executive thesis

<img src="logo.png" alt="tlsscope" width="160" height="160" /> Inspect a live TLS handshake from the command line. Print the certificate chain, negotiated protocol, and policy findings as JSON or SARIF. `openssl s_client` is powerful and noisy. CI jobs usually want: is this host still on TLS 1.2+, is the leaf trusted, and how many days until expiry Ã¢â‚¬â€ as JSON (or SARIF for GitHub code scanning).

**Why a buyer cares:** tlsscope packages transferable product IP â€” source, docs, in-repo brand assets, and a diligence room under `docs/acquisition/` â€” under a clear proprietary posture so diligence can proceed without mistaking the repo for open source.

## 2. Product snapshot

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Product | tlsscope |
| Repo | `theworker02/tlsscope` |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Open source? | **No** â€” proprietary |
| Rightsholder | theworker02 |
| Diligence pack | `docs/acquisition/` |

### Capability highlights (from current materials)

- Core product sources and documentation in this repository
- Proprietary commercial packaging (LICENSE + ACQUISITION.md)
- Buyer diligence materials under docs/acquisition/

## 3. Problem / opportunity

Teams evaluating tlsscope typically need either (a) a commercial right to run or embed it, or (b) outright ownership of the Product IP for strategic build-out. Public GitHub visibility without a proprietary license creates false assumptions about free production use. This brief and the linked data room make the commercial path explicit.

---

## 4. What ships today

Honest maturity: treat repository contents, README claims, tests, and release tags as the source of truth. Do not assume production customers, ARR, filed patents, or SLAs unless separately evidenced in diligence.

Typical transferable surfaces:

- Source tree and build/test scripts present in-repo
- Documentation and design notes
- Acquisition / diligence markdown under `docs/acquisition/`
- Branding assets committed to the repository (if any)

## 5. Demo / evaluation path (buyer)

Minimal path (no secrets required unless README says otherwise):

```
```bash
npm install -g @magnexis/tlsscope
npx @magnexis/tlsscope --help
```
```text
tlsscope inspect example.com
tlsscope inspect example.com:8443
tlsscope inspect https://example.com/health
tlsscope check example.com --min-days 30 --min-protocol TLSv1.2
tlsscope check example.com --sarif -o tls.sarif
tlsscope policy
```
```yaml
- run: npx @magnexis/tlsscope check api.example.com --sarif -o tls.sarif
- uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  with:
    sarif_file: tls.sarif
```
```ts
import { inspectTarget, evaluate, defaultPolicy } from "@magnexis/tlsscope";

const report = await inspectTarget("example.com", 443);
const findings = evaluate(report, defaultPolicy());
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/theworker02/tlsscope.git
cd tlsscope
npm install
npm test
npm run build
```
```

Extended evaluation: `docs/acquisition/BUYER_EVALUATION.md`. Written NDA / evaluation grants may be required for private materials.

## 6. What a transaction typically includes

Subject to definitive schedules:

| Included (typical) | Excluded (typical) |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Repo materials + asserted original IP | Seller personal accounts / unrelated repos |
| Docs + diligence room at closing | Third-party dependency source under separate licenses |
| In-repo brand marks as assigned | Secrets without rotation plan |
| Know-how captured in docs | Fabricated revenue, user, or adoption metrics |

---

## 7. Suggested deal structures

| Structure | When it fits |
|-----------|--------------|
| Non-exclusive commercial license | Deploy/run under seat or environment terms |
| Exclusive field-of-use license | Buyer wants exclusivity; seller may retain entity |
| Asset / IP assignment | Buyer wants ownership of Materials outright |
| OEM / redistribution | Separate agreement â€” not implied here |

Commercial terms (price, earnouts, escrow) are negotiated under NDA with counsel.

## 8. Buyer diligence checklist

- [ ] Confirm Rightsholder identity and authority to sell/license
- [ ] Inventory Materials (`docs/acquisition/ASSET_INVENTORY.md`)
- [ ] Review IP posture (`IP_PROVENANCE.md`) and dependencies (`DEPENDENCY_INVENTORY.md`)
- [ ] Run evaluation script (`BUYER_EVALUATION.md`)
- [ ] Review risks (`RISK_REGISTER.md`)
- [ ] Agree transfer scope (`TRANSFER_MANIFEST.md`) and handoff (`HANDOFF_CHECKLIST.md`)
- [ ] Supersede root `LICENSE` at closing via definitive agreement
